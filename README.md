This project explores the relationship between various health and lifestyle factors and the likelihood of experiencing a brain stroke, using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Through data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis, I investigate key predictors such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and smoking habits. The goal is to highlight how these features correlate with stroke outcomes and emphasize the role of preventative health screening.
